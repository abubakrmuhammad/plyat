With Masters Tokyo beginning in just under a week's time, here's all you need to know about the Americas representatives coming into the event.

As Riot has ensured that each group contains only one team from each participating region, none of the Americas teams will play each other until the playoffs, if at all. That means there'll be no rematches in the quickly forming rivalry between Evil Geniuses and NRG Esports or the long-time rivalry between NRG and LOUD until the tournament is down to its final few teams.

### LOUD

This year, the kings from Brazil continued their perfect record of domestic championships by taking home the Americas League trophy, earning them their third victory over their home region in as many tries. As the Americas first seed, LOUD head directly to playoffs with Team Liquid, FNATIC, and Paper Rex, and like their playoffs-locked counterparts, they will have at least five extra days to prepare for Masters Tokyo.

LOUD come into Masters Tokyo on a four-win hot streak and a flawless playoffs run, having dropped only a single map to Evil Geniuses in the upper bracket finals. They are also currently the only franchised team running Chamber in their lineup; IGL saadhak plays the agent as their sole sentinel pick on Bind.

The Brazilian super team are among the favorites to take the tournament. If they reach the grand finals at Masters Tokyo, they will have made it to a top two place in four out of the last five international tournaments.

This includes the VCT's last international LAN, LOCK//IN. In that tournament, LOUD lost to FNATIC in the grand finals 3-2. While FNATIC didn't take home the EMEA League trophy, they did dominate their region for most of the split much like LOUD did. As two of Tokyo's favorites, a late-tournament rematch is more likely than not for the two powerhouse squads.

### NRG Esports

The OpTic core is nothing if not consistent. Despite the team's storied history, including a Masters title, they have never won a domestic title. And their success has frequently relied on lower-bracket runs.

That happened once again when NRG lost to Evil Geniuses on the first day of the Americas League playoffs and then won three straight matches to qualify for Masters, make the grand finals and then lose to destined rivals LOUD to secure the Americas League's second seed.

However, NRG's streak of consistency almost came to an end. The team started the VCT Americas season in dire straits, falling to a 1-3 record by their fourth match. But from there, NRG hit their stride and won all five of their remaining regular season matches â€” including a match in which NRG inflicted LOUD with their only loss of the season.

Coming into the 2023 season, NRG kept s0m and signed ardiis to complete their starting roster. Despite some early doubts, s0m and ardiis have slotted well into their respective roles and played integral parts in NRG's strong regular season and playoffs finish.

NRG will face off against ardiis' former teammates on Natus Vincere in their first match of the group stage. Owing to the OpTic core's storied history, NRG, like LOUD, are a favorite to win the tournament, and a potential LOUD vs. NRG rematch is something for fans to look forward to.
